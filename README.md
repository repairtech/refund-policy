# RepairTech Refund Policy

Refund policies can be complicated and frustrating. We wanted our Refund Policy to be straightforward and fair. If you ever feel unhappy with our products, just email support@repairtechsolutions.com and we'll take care of you.

### Examples of full refunds we'd grant
#### TechSuite
- If you were just charged for your next month of TechSuite, but you meant to cancel, we’re happy to refund that extra charge.
- If you forgot to cancel TechSuite a couple months ago, and you haven’t used TechSuite since then, we’ll give you a full refund for a few back months. No problem.

#### Kabuto
- If you were just charged for payment period of Kabuto, but you meant to cancel, we’re happy to refund that extra charge.

### Examples of partial refunds or credits we'd grant
#### TechSuite
- If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) we’d issue a partial credit to your account.

#### Kabuto
- If the account's plan is downgraded in the middle of the year, the appropriate difference in price would be applied as credit.
